# Predicting Loan Default For German Loan Dataset Using Multiple Machine Learning Models and evaluating each model

Introduction:
--------------
This project aims to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on historical data provided by a German bank. The dataset contains information on various customer attributes such as employment duration, savings balance, credit history etc. Given the significant financial implications of loan defaults, accurately predicting defaults can help banks mitigate risk and make more informed lending decisions.

Objective:
--------------
The objective of this project is to build a fully reproducible workflow using machine learning (ML) models to address the problem of loan default prediction. Multiple ML models are applied to the data, and their performance is evaluated to identify the most effective model.

Project Organization:
----------------------
The project is organized into the following key components:

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
   - Data is first explored to understand its structure and content. 
   - Checked for missing values. There were no missing values. Additionally checked if there exists any duplicate rows.
   - Categorical variables, and numerical variables are handled appropriately.
   - Categorical variables are encoded using techniques such as one-hot encoding, and ordinal encoding.
   - Numerical variables are standardized before feeding it to machine learning model.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization:
   - Appropriate visualization plots are created to understand and make the right observations.
   - EDA is performed to have better understanding of the data distribution and also the relationship of the features of the dataset.

3. Model Training and Evaluation:
   - A variety of machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the dataset:
     1. Linear Regression
     2. Logistic Regression
     3. Decision Tree
     4. Random Forest
     5. Gradient Boosting
     6. Naive Bayes
     7. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     8. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     9. XGBoost
     10. LightGBM
     11. CatBoost
   - Each model's performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

4. Results and Discussion:
   - The performance metrics of each model were compared to identify the best-performing model.
   - LightGBM, Gradient Boosting and CatBoost were found to be the first three most effective models in predicting loan defaults based on their high accuracy and ROC-AUC scores.
   - The results, limitations, and potential improvements are discussed in the final report.

5. Final Report:
   - A comprehensive report in PDF format is included, structured with sections such as Introduction, Methods and Materials, Results, Discussion, and Conclusions.
   - The report includes visualizations and tables generated by the Python scripts, illustrating the findings of the project.

6. Code Documentation:
   - The Python scripts are well-documented, with comments explaining each step of the process.
   - The scripts are organized to allow full reproducibility of the analysis and results.

Instructions to Reproduce the Project:
---------------------------------------
To reproduce the analysis and results:

1. Ensure Python 3.10 installed on the system.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the command:
   ```
   `pip install _____` 
   ```
   Here the _____ must be replaced with the library name mentioned used in my python code 
3. Run the Python scripts in the order same as that of my python file (.ipynb)
4. Refer the generated report (Final_Report.pdf) to understand the project implementation and for more details.

Conclusion:
-----------
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning models to predict loan default. Through careful data preprocessing, EDA, data visualizations, and model evaluation, the project identifies LightGBM as the most effective model for this task. The workflow is fully reproducible, and the code is well-documented to facilitate understanding and replication of the analysis.
